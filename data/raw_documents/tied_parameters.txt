Tied Parameters in neural networks refer to weight sharing between different layers or components. This technique reduces model complexity and prevents overfitting by constraining certain weights to have identical values.

In practice, tied parameters are commonly used in:
- Autoencoders (encoder and decoder weights)
- Siamese networks (shared feature extractors)  
- Recurrent neural networks (time-step weight sharing)
- Convolutional layers (filter weight sharing)

Benefits include reduced memory usage, faster training, and better generalization.
